# Exploring pig single cell immune tissue Shiny App
This Shiny app allows interactive exploration of scRNA-seq data across four porcine immune tissues (Bone marrow, spleen, thymus, lymph node).

# This interactive app features: 
Home Page: Includes ready-to-use and preprocessed .cloupe files, and cell-type-specific differential gene expression analysis.
Gene Expression Page: Visualize expression of selected or typed-in genes across tissues using cell annotations, UMAP, and violin plots.
Reference Mapping Page: Compare immune cell types from the reference (Bone Marrow) to predicted cell types in other tissues.

** Large data files (.rds, .cloupe) are excluded from this repository
